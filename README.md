# 2525-interpreter

This repo is a minimal and early prototype program to interpret MILSTD 2525 (FM 1-02) maps.  The challenge was posed: can you interpret a paper map with post-its of unit icons?

This program uses the [segment-anything](https://segment-anything.com/) model from Meta to find the bounding boxes of the post-its and interpret the icon inside.  Note that it does *not* look at unit size markings at this time.

See [simpler map.png](simpler%20map.png) for an example input and [processed.png](processed.png) for its output.

[map_board.py](map_board.py) is the main program, which uses the [predict2525.py](predict2525.py) module.

The icons used were generated by programs in the [eg2525](https://github.com/stephen-riley/eg2525) repo.
